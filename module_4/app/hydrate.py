"""Hydration: extracted entities get their facts from SQLite, never from the LLM.

The extractor finds *who and what* a message mentions ("Maya Chen", "Pro"). This
file looks each name up in the Acme Cloud system of record and copies the
grounded facts (email, plan, refund limit, ...) onto the entity node. When the
SQL record changes, the next mention refreshes the node.

Two writes per entity (verified in spike 0.5, docs/verification-log.md):
  1. `long_term.add_entity` is the public upsert. On an existing node it
     refreshes `description` but not its attributes, which is an upstream
     limitation.
  2. So `PropertyWriter` sets the facts as flat node properties with its own
     driver. The memory client's Cypher surface is read-only.
